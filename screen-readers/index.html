	<h1>Demo Page for Screen-Readers Not Reading Spaces</h1>
	<div class="word-wrap">
		<p>
			This is a proof-of-concept page showing issues in NVDA and VoiceOver.
			In NVDA, spaces are not read, and in VoiceOver, words are read as single characters at a time.
			Some hidden text as an example:
		</p>
		<div class="hidden">
			This has no spaces in NVDA and as single characters in VoiceOver
		</div>
		<p>
			This appears to be caused by adding <code>word-wrap: break-word;</code> to a parent element.
			Applying <code>white-space: nowrap;</code> or <code>word-wrap: normal</code> seems to fix the issue.
			For example:
		</p>
		<div class="hidden" style="white-space: nowrap">
			Using white-space: nowrap, NVDA separates the words, and VoiceOver reads as a sentence.
		</div>
		<div class="hidden" style="word-wrap: normal">
			With "word-wrap: normal", NVDA reads this fine, but VoiceOver does so as a series of single words.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			Not using <code>word-wrap: break-word;</code> at all produces something like this:
		</p>
		<div class="hidden">
			NVDA has no issues, but VoiceOver still reads as individual words.
		</div>
		<p>
			My recommendation would be <code>white-space: nowrap</code> as it fixes the issues in both NVDA and VoiceOver,
			regardless of whether <code>word-wrap</code> was used on a parent element.
		</p>
